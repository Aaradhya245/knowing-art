    <h1>What is art ?</h1>
<p>When we hear the word art, some of our minds jump to museums or framed paintings. And in that context, some people think, I'm not really a big fan of art. I just don't get it. Or maybe they think of art as something that's just for intellectuals, or artsy people.</p>

 <p>But really, art is for anyone who wants to experience it, and it's often in more places than we might realize. Songs you like, movies you watch, poems, theater, even a quilt that your grandmother made: All of this, and more, is art.</p>
